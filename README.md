The CrystalCollector Game

There are four crystals displayed on the page which will act as buttons: amethyst, blue topaz, quartz and ruby.

The player will be shown a random number at the start of the game and asked to match that number.

When the player clicks on a crystal, the computer will add a specific amount of points to the player's total score.

The number value associated with the crystal is hidden until the player clicks a crystal.
    When the player clicks a crystal, the crystal's value is added to a running total.

The player wins if their total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game.

The player loses if their score goes above the random number.

The new game starts whenever the player wins or loses.

At every game start: the player will see a new random number, and all the crystals will have a new hidden value.
